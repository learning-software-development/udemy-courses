In the world of the far\nfuture, Father Clement the warrior priest and Imago the stained glass robot\nwill stop at nothing to find Him...so they can KILL Him.

Fifty years later, a team of explorers\nmounts a search, riding a space elevator into the heart of the unknown. One\nscientist, Gabriel Shard, holds the key to the truth, the last chance to recover\nthe missing...but he might just die before he can use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Secret of the Ultimate Male Enhancement\":  The male enhancement of tomorrow has\neverything from shape-changing powers to a mind of its own.

Ten years of haunting by the digital ghost of\nhis victim, Frieda, have left him a basket case…but freedom awaits. If he can\njust make it till tomorrow, his sentence will end, and the digital ghost will\nbecome vaporware.

Don't ask Patty, the foul-mouthed\neverything-hater with a memory full of holes. Every time the lump on her head\nbuzzes, Cape Cod becomes Tijuana or vice versa. One minute, Patty sees\nlighthouses and well-dressed children; the next, she fends off pushy street\nkids and donkeys done up like zebras. Has she lost her mind, or is someone--or\nsomething--driving her crazy? Little by little, the truth seeps through...but\nthe dark secrets it forces to the surface might be far more terrible than any\nillusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eContents\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCollection of 6\nstories plus a novel preview\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eReviews\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robert Jeschonek is a towering talent.\" – Mike\nResnick, Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author of the \u003ci\u003eStarship\u003c/i\u003e series\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robert Jeschonek is the literary love child of Tim\nBurton and Neil Gaiman.\" – Adrian Phoenix, critically acclaimed author of \u003ci\u003eThe Maker's Song\u003c/i\u003e and\u003ci\u003e Hoodoo\u003c/i\u003e series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeschonek´s stories are delightfully insane, a\npleasure to read…\" – Fabio Fernandes, \u003ci\u003eFantasy\nBook Critic\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",
