This useful guidebook traces the myriad transformations of 'romance' from medieval courtly love to Mills and Boon, and claims that its elusive and complex nature serves as a touchstone for larger questions of literary and cultural theory, such as: How does the history of 'romance' as a category force us to rethink the historicization of literary genres? What definitions can we provide for our own time to help us recognize and analyze new forms of 'romance'? To what extent is the resistance to romance a resistance to the imaginative force of literature? The case for 'romance' as a concept is presented clearly and imaginatively, arguing that its usefulness to contemporary critics can be maintained if it is regarded as a literary strategy rather than a fixed genre. In encouraging the reader to consider the fluidity of literature, Romance will be of equal value to all students of historical and comparative literatures and of modern literary forms.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"041521260X"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780415212601"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":146,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Literary Criticism"],"contentVersion":"0.0.1.0.preview.1","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QZGMt8gSaasC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QZGMt8gSaasC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QZGMt8gSaasC&printsec=frontcover&dq=romance&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QZGMt8gSaasC&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Romance.html?hl=&id=QZGMt8gSaasC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"GB","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"GB","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/reader?id=QZGMt8gSaasC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"What definitions can we provide for our own time to help us recognize and analyze new forms of &#39;romance&#39;?

While it remains consistently dominant in bookstores and on best-seller lists, it is also widely dismissed by the critical community. Scholars have alleged that romance novels help create subservient readers, who are largely women, by confining heroines to stories that ignore issues other than love and marriage. Pamela Regis argues that such critical studies fail to take into consideration the personal choice of readers, offer any true definition of the romance novel, or discuss the nature and scope of the genre. Presenting the counterclaim that the romance novel does not enslave women but, on the contrary, is about celebrating freedom and joy, Regis offers a definition that provides critics with an expanded vocabulary for discussing a genre that is both classic and contemporary, sexy and entertaining. Taking the stance that the popular romance novel is a work of literature with a brilliant pedigree, Regis asserts that it is also a very old, stable form. She traces the literary history of the romance novel from canonical works such as Richardson's Pamela through Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Brontë's Jane Eyre, and E. M. Hull's The Sheik, and then turns to more contemporary works such as the novels of Georgette Heyer, Mary Stewart, Janet Dailey, Jayne Ann Krentz, and Nora Roberts.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780812203103"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0812203100"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":240,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Literary Criticism"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":9,"contentVersion":"1.2.1.0.preview.1","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GFcRKW0cjEwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GFcRKW0cjEwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GFcRKW0cjEwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=romance&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GFcRKW0cjEwC&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_Natural_History_of_the_Romance_Novel.html?hl=&id=GFcRKW0cjEwC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"GB","saleability":"FOR_SALE_AND_RENTAL","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":17.4,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"retailPrice":{"amount":11.31,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GFcRKW0cjEwC&dq=romance&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":17400000,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":11310000,"currencyCode":"GBP"}},{"finskyOfferType":3,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":15660000,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":10180000,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"rentalDuration":{"unit":"DAY","count":180}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"GB","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/download/A_Natural_History_of_the_Romance_Novel-sample-pdf.acsm?id=GFcRKW0cjEwC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/reader?id=GFcRKW0cjEwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The romance novel has the strange distinction of being the most popular but least respected of literary genres."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"EnUrreyCXRsC","etag":"78Edq37cGCk","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/EnUrreyCXRsC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Educated in Romance","subtitle":"Women, Achievement, and College Culture","authors":["Dorothy C.

Jeschonek will take you on a tour of the wildest places and people you've never imagined. You've never met anyone quite like 12:30 P.M., the fugitive time fragment...Frieda, the killer-haunting e-ghost...or Patty, the lunatic vagrant who keeps seeing Tijuana, Mexico where Cape Cod, Massachusetts should be. Don't miss these edgy, exciting, and surprising science fiction tales by a STAR TREK and DOCTOR WHO author. It’s the latest collection from award-winning storyteller Robert T. Jeschonek, a master of unique and unexpected science fiction that really packs a punch. This volume includes six scifi stories for one low price: \"Warning! Do Not Read This Story!\": An entire town wiped out...by a rogue story? Anyone who hears or reads it launches into a murder-suicide spree, and its power is about to spread to the rest of the world. Only Carrol and Sascha LaVerge, mystic problem-solving sisters extraordinaire, stand in its way. Tracking the story's power to an ancient evil, Carrol and Sascha race against time to stop it from escaping town and triggering an apocalypse. But can they outsmart the story with a mind of its own before it comes up with a plot twist that traps them in the ultimate unhappy ending? \"Tempus Fugitive\": What form will the Second Coming of Christ take? In the world of the far future, Father Clement the warrior priest and Imago the stained glass robot will stop at nothing to find Him...so they can KILL Him. It's the only way to save the King of the World and his Kingdom from the great threat predicted in the Book of Revelations. Will a mysterious prisoner lead the way to their target Messiah, or will she help them realize they're serving an evil cause? \"Luminaria\": On a day known forever as The Silencing, millions of human colonists went missing in space without a trace. Fifty years later, a team of explorers mounts a search, riding a space elevator into the heart of the unknown. One scientist, Gabriel Shard, holds the key to the truth, the last chance to recover the missing...but he might just die before he can use it. \"The Secret of the Ultimate Male Enhancement\": The male enhancement of tomorrow has everything from shape-changing powers to a mind of its own. But what happens when this miraculous endowment refuses to cooperate with its new owner? War breaks out between man and enhancement, the ultimate struggle between two minds in one body. Only by guessing the enhancement's dark secret does the man stand a chance of breaking the stranglehold this high tech smart-part has on his life. \"The Memory of You Lingers\": Baird the convicted rapist knows no peace. Ten years of haunting by the digital ghost of his victim, Frieda, have left him a basket case…but freedom awaits. If he can just make it till tomorrow, his sentence will end, and the digital ghost will become vaporware. But Frieda has no intention of leaving quietly, and the going-away present she has in store for Baird could be far worse than the digital nightmare he has already endured. \"Tijuana, Massachusetts\": Why does Cape Cod, Massachusetts keep changing into Tijuana, Mexico? Don't ask Patty, the foul-mouthed everything-hater with a memory full of holes. Every time the lump on her head buzzes, Cape Cod becomes Tijuana or vice versa. One minute, Patty sees lighthouses and well-dressed children; the next, she fends off pushy street kids and donkeys done up like zebras. Has she lost her mind, or is someone--or something--driving her crazy? Little by little, the truth seeps through...but the dark secrets it forces to the surface might be far more terrible than any illusion.

Kiser"],"publisher":"KiseSoft unInc.","publishedDate":"2012-10-30","description":"A 6'5\" starship captain flees a lost war and lands on Earth in 1600s feudal Japan. Imagine the possibilities! Imagine being light years from home and landing on a large island populated by war-like people almost half your size. A serious culture clash, the disparity is obvious. Will they look upon him as a god from the heavens or a demon from the skies? His survival skills may well be put to the test. Kendrick - a starship captain and well-trained warrior loyal to his people and his cause, but the war is lost. He is forced to flee across the galaxy. Gogenko - a pedantic shukido (area protector) trained in the tradition of Bushido, the Way of the Warrrior. Kenshi - Gogenko’s cousin, fellow martial arts student, and shukido to Honashi Village. Doiyoko - the beautiful if untraditional oldest daughter of the Honashi Village leader. Will they be fast friends or formidable foes? Reviews: ***** Great fun! This book is just a lot of fun! With flavors of Samurai and Steam-punk adding spice, it rocks along from delight to surprise, and all along it is highly satisfying. Oh, on first reading, towards the end I thought maybe it bogged down. But it is the sort of book you want to re-read as soon as you finish it, because it was just so much fun. And I found out I was wrong: the story continues apace, right to the last page. And the ending is a pure delight. Don't peek, you won't get it. But I can assure you: it will give you huge satisfaction, and you will be glad you chose to read this book. ·· William Fletcher **** ...Overall, this is an entertaining book on many levels. Those who enjoy reading about real-life and science fiction technology will enjoy the technical parts. Those who like laser fights and battles between uneven forces where the underdog must overcome long odds will enjoy the battles. Those who like strong women who overcome social barriers and can hold their own will enjoy Doiyoko, Kendrick's love interest. Those who enjoy a little mystical and technological awesomeness in their main character will love Kendrick. And, finally, those who enjoy humorous situations and camaraderie will find more than a sufficient dose in this book to satisfy their funny bones. ·· Patricia Hamill on Goodreads ***** Exciting - this is the most appropriate word to describe Exile. Author R.L. Kiser put a bit of everything in the story. Apart from the prime sci-fi adventure theme, there is romance between Kendrick and Doiyoko, the beautiful but unconventional eldest daughter of the Honashi Village leader. There is also a fairly healthy dose of humor packed into this story. I do appreciate the way it is written in two parts: Kendrick's first arrival and his developing relationship with his new friends in part one; how he copes with his new life years later in part two. I think this approach maintains the good pacing of the story. Simply put, Exile is a stellar work from Kiser, with appealing characters and an absorbing tale. ·· Lit Amri for Readers' Favorite","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781300423911"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1300423919"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":256,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"contentVersion":"1.6.6.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jEmjqzVOoJEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jEmjqzVOoJEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jEmjqzVOoJEC&pg=PP1&dq=scifi&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jEmjqzVOoJEC&dq=scifi&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Exile_A_SciFi_Adventure.html?hl=&id=jEmjqzVOoJEC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"GB","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":2.39,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"retailPrice":{"amount":1.98,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jEmjqzVOoJEC&dq=scifi&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":2390000,"currencyCode":"GBP"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":1980000,"currencyCode":"GBP"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"GB","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/reader?id=jEmjqzVOoJEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"R.L.

As global festivals such as the Olympic games and football's World Cup demonstrate, sport's social, political, economic and cultural significance is becoming increasingly apparent across the world. Its popularity alone means that sociologists cannot ignore sport. Chapter-by-chapter, Giulianotti offers a cogent examination of a range of widely taught sociological theories and issues that relate to sport. These include functionalism, Weberian sociology, Marxism, postmodern sociology, and globalisation. The author's use of an international range of case studies and research, about a wide variety of sports, helps to make his account especially accessible to undergraduate readers. 'Sport: a critical sociology' will therefore have strong appeal to upper-level undergraduates on courses such as sport and leisure studies, cultural studies, and modern social theory.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780745625454"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0745625452"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":267,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Social Science"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":2,"contentVersion":"0.2.1.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-fGmwe2AVWIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-fGmwe2AVWIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-fGmwe2AVWIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=sport&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-fGmwe2AVWIC&dq=sport&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Sport.html?hl=&id=-fGmwe2AVWIC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"GB","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"GB","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/download/Sport-sample-epub.acsm?id=-fGmwe2AVWIC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/reader?id=-fGmwe2AVWIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In this lively new book, Richard Giulianotti provides a critical sociological interpretation of modern sport."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"VURz3uFWLFYC","etag":"/D9kGMlM6aA","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/VURz3uFWLFYC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Imagery in Sport","authors":["Tony Morris","Michael Spittle","Anthony P.

But most material on the subject has been, to this point, relegated to single chapters in books, to journal articles, or to conference proceedings. Now Imagery in Sportaddresses the breadth of what researchers and practitioners in sport psychology know about the topic, and it treats each issue in depth, considering current theories and research on imagery and its application in sport. The reference also addresses future directions in research and practice for imagery in sport. In doing so, Imagery in Sportprovides the most comprehensive look at the state of imagery and its uses in sport today. The authors take readers step by step through understanding, investigating, applying, and advancing imagery in sport. The text includes the following: -Sample scripts, preperformance suggestions, and sport-specific and site-specific tips -Presentation and critical analysis of 10 well-known theoretical frameworks for understanding imagery -A full chapter devoted to understanding and successfully using the available measures of imagery in sport, including how to administer imagery-ability measures Imagery in Sporttakes complex theories and presents them clearly, using examples from everyday sport contexts. The book helps readers become familiar with the current knowledge about the topic and learn to view it with a critical eye. And it provides practicing sport psychologists with guidelines and strategies for using imagery to help athletes improve their performances.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0736037527"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780736037525"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":387,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Education"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":1,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VURz3uFWLFYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VURz3uFWLFYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VURz3uFWLFYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=sport&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VURz3uFWLFYC&dq=sport&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Imagery_in_Sport.html?hl=&id=VURz3uFWLFYC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"GB","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"GB","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/download/Imagery_in_Sport-sample-epub.acsm?id=VURz3uFWLFYC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/reader?id=VURz3uFWLFYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The text includes the following: -Sample scripts, preperformance suggestions, and sport-specific and site-specific tips -Presentation and critical analysis of 10 well-known theoretical frameworks for understanding imagery -A full chapter ..."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"eDFRHrZV53YC","etag":"vIxfbrVcxA8","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/eDFRHrZV53YC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Sport Marketing","subtitle":"Managing the Exchange Process","authors":["George R.

Szymanski"],"publisher":"Edward Elgar Publishing","publishedDate":"2005","description":"The editors should be commended for taking on such a big task, and succeeding so well. This book should be in the library of every institution where students have to write a paper that may be related to sport, or on the shelf of any lecturer teaching economics or public finance who has even a remote interest in sport. The material is very accessible, and useful in many different settings. Ruud H. Koning, Jahrbücher f. Nationalökonomie u. Statistik Edward Elgar s brilliant market niche is identifying a topic in economics, finding editors who know the area backwards and challenging them to assemble the best cross-section of relevant articles either already published or newly commissioned. Handbook on the Economics of Sport is Edward Elgar at its very best. If you love economics you ll find many fascinating insights here; if you love sport but know little economics then this book is mostly accessible and will teach you a lot; and if you are a sports-mad economist then you will be in hog heaven. Furthermore, if, like this reviewer, you are broadly very sceptical about the reports consultants produce for governments on the supposed economic windfall from hosting a big event or subsidising a stadium then you will get a lot of good counter-arguments in this volume. Indeed there are several chapters on the above theme that I m sure I ll be copying frequently to government officials in years to come. . . The demand for sport is a fascinating subject and it is hard to pick out just one chapter from the second section. Read them all they make a wonderful 65-page treat. . . Part VI was a real feast, a smorgasbord. . . This is a magnificent piece of work and the 36-page index rounds it all off splendidly. John Blundell, Economic Affairs The book covers the most important areas of research of an emerging economic sub-discipline spanning the past half a century. It serves admirably the purpose of an introduction into the rich and growing area of reflection for all concerned. . . the editors and authors of the Handbook have done a commendable job of accumulating sophisticated material for many economists, managers, politicians and self-conscious fans, who are sure to find excellent training ground for the whole heptathlon. . . This book will be invaluable for advanced students investigating professional sport. From the point of view of lawyers, particularly those engaged with the relationship between law and sports governance, the Handbook offers invaluable analysis of the economic issues that are alluded to in those debates but rarely examined in detail. . . These insights will also prove useful for policy analysts and sports administrators for whom many sections should be considered mandatory reading. Aleksander Sulejewicz, Journal of Contemporary European Research Over 800 pages on the economics of sport. What a feast! What a treat! The editors have done a wonderful job both in terms of breadth from David Beckham to child labour in Pakistan and depth, tournaments and luxury taxes for example. . . The 86 chapters are uniformly of a very high standard and illuminating. And there are real gems in some of the contributions. British Journal on the Economics of Sport This very interesting and comprehensive book achieves its objective, namely to present an overview of research in sports economics at an introductory level. . . [The editors] have produced an excellent reference book that belongs in all academic institutions libraries. It provides extensive introduction to the growing body of literature in the rising field of economics of sport. The book s relevant monographs should be read by institutions, cities and countries prior to their committing major resources towards sports facilities or a sporting event.

The text is written by 34 of the field's most prolific researchers and scholars, including Maureen Weiss, Shane Murphy, and Albert Carron. These contributors extend the boundaries that have defined the field and provide a clear direction for future research. This third edition has been completely revised to reflect the advances that have occurred in the field within the past several years. The text provides readers with a complete picture of current research and emerging topics in sport psychology while challenging researchers to examine the factors that keep this discipline growing. Advances in Sport Psychology, Third Edition, provides a fresh look at sport psychology with these features: -Four new chapters on qualitative research methods, achievement goal theories, self-confidence, and family and peer influences -Significant revisions of the second-edition chapters, along with more concise overviews of individual topics -An analysis and synthesis of the state of knowledge for each topic and a discussion of future research directions The text focuses on the most important and active areas of current research, which recognize the merging of individual and socioenvironmental factors in making sense of sport performance and behavior. Each chapter includes a definition of terms, an explanation of the chapter's scope, and an outline of the sections. The author then provides a review of the available research and theory on the chapter's main topic, analyzes the state of knowledge in the area, and devotes significant space to future research directions. The book is divided into four parts. Part Ioffers a comprehensive introduction to the field, including definitions, history, and research paradigms and methodologies. Part IIexplores individual characteristics that affect sport participants' behavior, including self-perceptions, attributional patterns and perceptions of control, motivational orientations, and achievement goal perspectives. Part IIIexplores socioenvironmental factors that affect sport participants' behaviors. Part IVdelves into the research and theory concerning intervention techniques used for enhancing performance and modifying athletes' behaviors, including imagery and mental rehearsal, attentional processes, goal setting, and flow and peak performance. Advances in Sport Psychology, Third Edition, offers a new and thorough understanding of where sport psychology has been, where it is now, and where it is headed. This text will help students prepare and conduct their own research, and it will be a great reference for professionals who want to stay on the cutting-edge of the field.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0736057358"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780736057356"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":499,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Medical"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":1,"contentVersion":"3.1.0.0.preview.1","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wxDkz6akXiwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wxDkz6akXiwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wxDkz6akXiwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=sport&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wxDkz6akXiwC&dq=sport&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Advances_in_Sport_Psychology.html?hl=&id=wxDkz6akXiwC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"GB","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"GB","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/reader?id=wxDkz6akXiwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This text will help students prepare and conduct their own research, and it will be a great reference for professionals who want to stay on the cutting-edge of the field."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"ZRD6gMj2XRkC","etag":"mn5CcekZQaA","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ZRD6gMj2XRkC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Sport Business Management in Aotearoa/New Zealand","authors":["Sarah Leberman","Christopher William Collins","Linda Trenberth"],"publisher":"Cengage Learning Australia","publishedDate":"2006","description":"Sport Business Management in Aotearoa/New Zealand provides comprehensive and up-to-date coverage of the basic principles and practice of management and their application to the business of sport.

This second edition includes new chapters focussing on Ma-ori sport and its management; sport in the global market place; strategic alliances; sport and the law; and facility management. Other chapters have been either updated or rewritten to reflect the current sporting environment in Aotearoa/New Zealand. The chapters in Sport Business Management in Aotearoa/New Zealand have been written in such a way that they can be read independently from each other, and as such the book does not need to be read in order. However, the book has been organised to follow a logical flow: Section One - provides an understanding of the context within which sport management operates in Aotearoa/New Zealand; Section Two - focuses on key management themes as applied to sport; Section Three - considers the business of managing sport and, as such, contains chapters with more practical applications. Sport Business Management in Aotearoa/New Zealand is a useful resource for students, practitioners, volunteers and those who have an interest in the administration and management of sport.
